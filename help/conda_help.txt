# Step 1.  Install Anaconda


# Step 2. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/melindadevins/ai-loan-analysis.git


# Step 3. Change dir to the repo, and create the environment em_hack from the github file (on PC):
conda env create -f environment_pc.yaml


# Mac
conda env create -f environment_mac.yaml


# Step 3. Activate em_hack environment
activate em_hack


# Mac
source activate em_hack


# Step 4. Launch notebook
jupyter notebook


# It should auto launch the browser, if not, from a browser, go to: http://localhost:8888  or the output url from running the above command.




# Step 5. Add new packaged to an existing environment
# 1>  activate an existing environment by following Step 3


# 2>  install the new package either via "pip install", or "conda install", depends on which one is managing the package
conda install matplotlib
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.1


# 3> Save your new environment to the file environment_pc.yaml or environment_mac.yaml
conda env export > environment_pc.yaml    (if you are on PC)
conda env export > environment_mac.yaml  (if you are on Mac)


# 4> Checkin the file to github to share with the team
git add *
git commit -m "Modify env file"
git push


# 5> Other team members do a "git pull" to refresh the environment yaml file, then delete the em_hack on your machine, re-create it by following Step 3
# or follow the step 5 to add the new packages when em_hack is activated


___________ # Other helpful commands: ________


# Deactivate the environment
deactivate em_hack  


# Mac
source deactivate em_hack


# Create a new conda environment from scratch with packages  
conda create -n my_new_env python=3 numpy pandas SciPy scikit-learn
activate my_new_env


#Save current environment to a file. The environment must be activated. 
conda env export > environment_pc.yaml        (if on PC)
conda env export > environment_mac.yaml        (if on Mac)


#List the existing environments on your machine:
conda env list


# Delete an environment (Never delete the root)
conda env remove -n my_env_to_be_deleted
